## Overview
The **Waste Segregation and Weight-Based Reward System** is an intelligent solution that promotes proper waste management by automatically segregating waste and rewarding users based on the weight of correctly disposed waste. This project encourages sustainability and responsible behavior in households, offices, and public spaces.

---

## Features
- **Smart Waste Segregation:** Automatically sorts waste into categories: Organic, Plastic, Paper, and Metal.  
- **Weight Measurement:** Accurate measurement of disposed waste using load sensors.  
- **Reward System:** Users earn points or incentives based on weight and proper segregation.  
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides instant feedback on waste disposal accuracy.  
- **Humanoid/Interactive Interface (Optional):** A humanoid guide helps users segregate waste correctly.

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller: Arduino / ESP32 / Raspberry Pi  
- Load cell / Weight sensor  
- Servo motors / Actuators for segregation  
- Waste bins or compartments  
- Humanoid display or touchscreen (optional)  
- IR/Ultrasonic sensors for object detection  

---

## Software Requirements
- Programming Languages: Python / C++ / Arduino IDE  
- Database: MySQL / Firebase / MongoDB (for user data and rewards)  
- Machine Learning (Optional): For waste type recognition  
- User Interface: Web or mobile app for reward tracking  

---

## How It Works
1. User deposits waste into the input area.  
2. Sensors detect the type of waste.  
3. Waste is sorted into appropriate bins automatically.  
4. Load sensor measures the weight of the waste.  
5. User earns reward points based on weight and type of waste.  
6. Data is stored for analytics and future insights.  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with city-wide recycling programs.  
- Gamification: Levels, badges, and leaderboards for users.  
- AI-powered visual recognition for complex waste items.  
- Mobile app integration for real-time notifications of rewards.
